     npm install
     ```
   - Start the Angular development server:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

3. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```
   - Build and run the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run

   - The backend will run at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE cycle_rental_db;
     ```
   - Import the database schema provided in the `database.sql` file:
     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p cycle_rental_db < database.sql
     ```

5. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**:
   - Update the Angular environment configuration file (`src/environments/environment.ts`) to point to the backend API:
     ```typescript
     export const environment = {
       production: false,
       apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api'
     };
     ```

6. **Start the System**:
   - Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
